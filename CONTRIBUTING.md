# `rustdoc` contribution guidelines

Thank you for your interest in making `rustdoc` better! We'd love to have your
contribution. We expect all contributors to abide by the [Rust code of
conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html), which you can find at
that link or in the [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](https://github.com/steveklabnik/rustdoc/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in this repository.

## License

`rustdoc` is dual licenced under the MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses, and so are all
contributions. Please see the [`LICENSE-MIT`](https://github.com/steveklabnik/rustdoc/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT) and [`LICENSE-APACHE`](https://github.com/steveklabnik/rustdoc/blob/master/LICENSE-APACHE) files in this directory for more
details.

## Pull Requests

To make changes to `rustdoc`, please send in pull requests on GitHub to the
`master` branch. We'll review them and either merge or request changes. Travis
CI tests everything as well, so you may get feedback from it too.

If you make additions or other changes to a pull request, feel free to either amend
previous commits or only add new ones, however you prefer. We may ask you to squash
your commits before merging, depending.

One tricky bit with contributing to the frontend, in the `frontend` directory:
if you make changes here, you'll need to remove the older files from
`frontend\dist\` and commit the new ones. More detail in the "Frontend
Development Workflow" section below.


## Issue Tracker

You can find the issue tracker [on
GitHub](https://github.com/steveklabnik/rustdoc/issues). If you've found a problem with
`rustdoc`, please open an issue there.

We have several tags for issues:

 5 labels

* **help wanted** are issues explicitly marked for new contributors to work on.
  We'll help answer any questions you might have. If you've got your eyes on a
  ticket that doesn't have this tag, feel free to tackle it if you'd prefer!
  This is just a suggestion.
* **quest** issues are "big picture" things that are fairly open-ended, and are
  just waiting for some enthusiastic contributor to come along and knock them
  out! It's a lot of work, but you also have the chance to make a huge impact.
* **question** issues are for getting help with `rustdoc` in some way.
* **bug** issues track something `rustdoc` isn't doing correctly.
* **enhancement** issues keep track of things `rustdoc` should be doing that it
  doesn't do quite just yet.
* **refactoring** issues track work we can do to clean up the code a bit.
* **blocked on upstream** means that this bug is waiting on something in another
  repository; that might be the compiler, `rls-analysis`, or something else.

## Frontend Development Workflow

To work on the front end, you'll need:

* `nodejs` (We use 7.2.1 but any recent version should be fine)
* `npm` (This should come with node, but you may want to upgrade to npm5)

From there, do this:

```bash
> cd frontend
> npm install
```

And you'll get everything else you need, primarily, the `ember` command-line
tool.

We store a sample `data.json` in the `public` directory, so you don't have to worry
about the backend at all to work on the front end; think of it as test data. To
get started:

```bash
> ember serve
```

This will open up a copy of the site on [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/).
If you're using the sample data, the sample crate is called "example" and so you'll need
to look at [http://localhost:4200/example](http://localhost:4200/example).

This should reload as you change things automatically.

Before sending in a pull request, you'll need to update the vendored assets. First do
this, to remove them:

```bash
> rm -r dist
```

And then do this, to regenerate them:

```bash
> ember build -prod
```

You'll see some files in `dist\assets` be removed, and new ones added.

## Backend Development Workflow

To work on the backend, you'll need:

* Rust, specifically, nightly Rust. We hope to move to stable, but cannot just
  yet, as some dependencies require nightly.
* Cargo (comes with Rust 99% of the time)

To build the project:

```bash
> cargo build
```

Your first build will take longer, because it also has to build the
dependencies.

To run tests:

```bash
> cargo test
```

To test out rustdoc's functionality, you'll want to run it on another crate.
The `--manifest-path` flag is a good way to point at the project you want to
try to build docs for. For example, if you were going to build the docs for
the `example` crate, located in this repo, you'd type this:

```bash
> cargo run -- --manifest-path=example build
```

"build" is the subcommand to build the docs, and `--manifest-path` should point
to a directory where a `Cargo.toml` lives.
